EXPERIENCE
Kyung Hee University, Surface Physics & Organic Nano Device Laboratory Sep 2022 - Feb 2024
Research Internship Seoul, Republic of Korea
• Collaborated with the Korea Research Institute of Standards and Science (KRISS) to generate and analyze high-
resolution X-ray Photoelectron Spectroscopy (XPS) data (+100K spectra) for surface contamination layer identification
• Designed and trained a 1D Convolutional Deep Neural Network (4.5M parameters) to predict elemental composition and
contamination layers from spectral data
• Achieved an R² = 0.998, demonstrating exceptional accuracy in quantitative surface analysis and outperforming traditional
regression-based methods
• Automated AES/XPS data acquisition with centralized server integration, reducing manual preprocessing and visualization
time by ~40% through pipeline optimization
Kyung Hee University, Complex System & Information Laboratory Nov 2020 - Feb 2022
Research Internship Seoul, Republic of Korea
• Researched optical data restoration methods using Compressed Sensing, Deconvolution, PCA, and Machine Learning to
recover blurred signals caused by instrumental filters
• Implemented and evaluated algorithms for signal reconstruction with improved sharpness and noise robustness across
multiple optical datasets
• Managed and optimized a parallel computing server cluster supporting numerical simulations for four physics laboratories,
improving computational efficiency by ~30% and uptime reliability
• Developed and maintained Python libraries for Computational Physics coursework, enabling undergraduate students to
conduct numerical experiments and data visualization with ease
Maple Investment Partners, Investment Team May 2020 - Aug 2020
Data Science & Analytics Internship Seoul, Republic of Korea
• Developed an automated data collection and visualization system in Python and SQL to track real-time venture capital
investments in South Korea using web scraping and public APIs, aggregating +15K investment events
• Designed data pipelines to aggregate and clean investment metrics, delivering interactive dashboards for market trend
monitoring and early-stage opportunity detection
• Conducted in-depth data-driven statistical analysis on the Solar Energy upstream industry, presenting insights and forecasts
to investment partners to inform strategic decision-making using data visualization
PROJECT
Flow-Based Network Anomaly Detection with Transformer Model Sep 2025 - Dec 2025
• Compared the performance of sequence flow models, including Baseline Dense (single-flow model), CNN+LSTM, and
BERT, evaluating their ability to capture complex sequential patterns in network traffic for anomaly detection
• Achieve Macro F1 score of 0.8 and accuracy over 0.99 using the BERT model on UNSW-NB15 and CSE-CIC-IDS2018
datasets, highlighting its strong capability in detecting a wide range of network anomalies
